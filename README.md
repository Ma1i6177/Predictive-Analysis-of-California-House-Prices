# California Housing Prices Analysis (Tutorial Project)

## Project Overview
This project is my implementation of a data science tutorial focusing on the California Housing Prices dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Tutorial Source
This project is based on a tutorial by NeuralNine from YouTube. You can find the original tutorial here: [Full Data Science Project in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## My Learning Experience
By following this tutorial, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Using Python for data analysis and machine learning
- Working with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn
- Implementing a full data science workflow from data loading to model evaluation
- Handling real-world data challenges like missing values and categorical variables
- Applying feature engineering techniques to improve model performance
- Using hyperparameter tuning to optimize machine learning models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Steps

### Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using pandas
- Visualize data distributions and correlations

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Apply log transformation to skewed features
- One-hot encode categorical variables

### Feature Engineering
- Create new features: bedroom ratio and rooms per household
- Visualize geographical distribution of house prices

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train and evaluate models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

## Results
- Compare model performances
- Discuss the impact of feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning

## Results and Insights
- The Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression
- Feature engineering improved model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning didn't always lead to better results in this case

## Future Learning Goals
Based on this project, I'm interested in exploring:
- Advanced feature engineering techniques
- Other machine learning algorithms for regression problems
- More advanced hyperparameter tuning methods
- Deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios
